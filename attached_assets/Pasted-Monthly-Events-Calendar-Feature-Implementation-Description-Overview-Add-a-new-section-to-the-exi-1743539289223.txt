Monthly Events Calendar Feature - Implementation Description
Overview
Add a new section to the existing Sri Lanka Tourism Portal that showcases significant Sri Lankan events and festivals organized by month. This feature will help visitors plan their trips to coincide with cultural celebrations, festivals, or optimal weather conditions.
Feature Description
The Monthly Events Calendar will be implemented as an auto-rotating tab interface that cycles through all 12 months of the year, displaying relevant events and activities for each month in Sri Lanka.
Key Components
1. Monthly Tabs Interface
Create a horizontal tab navigation displaying all 12 months (January through December)
Implement visual indicators to show the currently active month
Style tabs with Sri Lankan-inspired design elements consistent with the site's aesthetics
Include auto-rotation functionality that switches to the next month every 10 seconds
Allow manual tab selection that pauses the auto-rotation temporarily
2. Monthly Content Panels
For each month, display:
2-4 high-quality images showcasing key events/attractions relevant to that month
Descriptive text highlighting:
Major festivals and cultural events
Religious celebrations
Regional specialties (e.g., Kandy Esala Perahera in July/August)
Seasonal activities (e.g., whale watching seasons, best hiking periods)
Weather information and travel recommendations
3. Visual Design & Animation
Implement smooth transitions between monthly tabs
Use subtle fade/slide animations when switching between months
Incorporate a visual progress indicator showing time until next automatic tab change
Ensure the section maintains the existing site's visual language with 3D elements, shadows, and rounded corners
Section Placement
Position this new section between the Services section and the Tour Packages section, making it an informative bridge between the company's offerings and the specific packages available.
User Interaction
Hovering over a month tab will pause the auto-rotation
Clicking a month tab will immediately display that month's content and temporarily pause rotation
Auto-rotation will resume after 30 seconds of user inactivity
On mobile devices, implement touch-friendly navigation with swipe capability
Technical Considerations
Use React state management to track the active month and control the rotation timer
Implement useEffect hooks to handle the interval timing and cleanup
Create a data structure to store all monthly event information
Ensure responsive design works across all device sizes
Optimize image loading to prevent performance issues when rotating tabs
Content Requirements
For each month, source and prepare:
Culturally accurate information about Sri Lankan events
High-quality, rights-cleared images of events and celebrations
Concise but informative descriptions
Any special travel considerations for the month (weather, crowds, etc.)
Performance Optimization
Implement lazy loading for images not in the current month
Preload the next month's content to ensure smooth transitions
Ensure the automatic rotation doesn't cause layout shifts or affect page performance
This implementation will enhance the user experience by providing valuable cultural context and helping visitors time their trips to experience Sri Lanka's rich calendar of events and optimal seasonal conditions.
