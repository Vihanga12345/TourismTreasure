# Sri Lanka Tourism Portal - Project Description

## Project Overview

This project involves developing a visually stunning, single-page React application for a Sri Lankan tourism business offering car rentals and tour packages. The website will focus on providing an immersive user experience with vibrant visuals, smooth animations, and intuitive booking processes. The application will primarily serve as a showcase and lead generation tool, allowing users to browse offerings and submit booking requests directly to the business administrator.

## Core Functionality

The website will operate without a backend database, instead utilizing email communication to forward booking requests to the administrator. The site will feature two main service categories: Tour Packages and Car Rentals, each with their own dedicated section and booking flows.

## Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js with modern Hooks and functional components
- **Styling**: CSS3 with SASS/SCSS, potentially using styled-components or Emotion
- **Animation Libraries**: Framer Motion, React Spring, AOS (Animate On Scroll)
- **Form Management**: Formik with Yup for validation
- **Email Service**: EmailJS for client-side email sending
- **UI Components**: Custom components with Material UI or Chakra UI for base elements
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- **State Management**: React Context API (Redux not necessary for this scope)
- **Build/Deployment**: Vite for development, Netlify/Vercel for hosting
